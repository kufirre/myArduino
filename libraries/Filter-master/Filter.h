/*
 *	I'd like to have a library I can call for basic filtering operations.
 *	
 *	Most sensors in small scale robotics are noisy.  For example as a
 *	mobile robot approaches a wall, an atached ulrasonic sensor should
 *	give readings in cm similar to the list below
 *
 *	11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...bump!
 *
 *	but all too often the data will come back like this
 *
 *  11, 10, 6, 8, 7, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 1, ..bump!
 *
 *  By filtering the raw data, via a moving average or other more 
 *	specialized filter we can use the noisy data as an input to our
 *	filter and then the processed data will give us a better linear
 *	output.  This linear output still doesn't match the exact distance
 *  to the wall, but it is a much closer approximation than the noisy
 *	data and provides a better set of data for the robot to make 
 *	control decisions from.
 *
 *	Since this filter library is designed to support Arduino applications
 *  I'm limiting it to only work on integer data.  I might add templating
 *  for arbitrary numeric types, but most Arduino users don't know how
 *  to instantiate a templated class, so it might not every get used.
